 // Bot Commands
 	"mvm_bot_spawn" - This command allows you to spawn a bot.

 	"mvm_bot_stare" - This command will make the bot look at the host.
 
 
 // Misc Commands
 	"about" - Prints credits and information on the screen.
 	"clone" - Spawns a clone of yourself
 	"clearbodies" - Deletes all dead bodies
 	"mvm_eb_close" - Toggles on/off close explosive bullets
 
 // To-Do
	I know this mod is very bare bones and there is not much to it, but in time I will try to implement every part of Sass' mod into Black Ops. You can only spawn one bot at a time, and I have not yet implemented a way to kill the bot via command.

	* Add the ability to differentiate between bot names for ease of use with commands.
	* Add the ability to spawn bots and choosing "class" and "team".
	* Add "kill" command. "mvm_bot_kill"
	* Add "vision" command. "mvm_env_colors"
	* Add "bot model" command. "mvm_bot_model"
	* Add "hold gun" command. // "mvm_bot_holdgun"
	* Add "score" command. // "mvm_score"
	* Add "killstreak command. // "mvm_killstreak"
