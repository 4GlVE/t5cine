This mod was designed for video editors who needs to create cinematics in the Multiplayer version of the game Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2.

It is not an external tool. This mod creates new variables (dvars) that executes a script when modified. This is not a game engine modification either. This is all done through scripting using GSC.

<br/>The purpose of the mod is to craft and create cinematic scenes or clips, using a plentiful of different features. Ideally, the only thing that would limit the user is its own creativity...

<br/><br/>
## Requirements

In order to use this mod, you'll need a copy of Black Ops 1 with or without a client installed.

<br/><br/>
## Installation

Simply download the mod through [this link]([https://github.com/4GlVE/t5cine/releases/latest]). Scroll down and click on "Source code (zip)" and download the file.

Once the mod downloaded, open the ZIP file and drag the "mp_t5cine" folder into your `BO1/mods` folder. If the `mods` folder doesn't exist, create it. (*You can also rename the mod if you'd like.*)

```text
C:/
└── .../
    └── BO1/
        └── mods/
            └── mp_t5cine
```

Once this is done open your game, then click on the "Mods" tab. "Cinematic Mod" should appear in the list; click on it once and then click on "Launch" to restart your game with the mod on.
