# *t5cine - A Black Ops Cinematic Mod*


**A GSC modification for t5 to create cinematics.**

## Installation

Simply download the mod through [this link]([https://github.com/4GlVE/t5cine/releases/latest]). Scroll down and click on "Source code (zip)" and download the file.

Once the mod downloaded, open the ZIP file and drag the "mp_t5cine" folder into your `BO1/mods` folder. If the `mods` folder doesn't exist, create it.

```text
C:/
└── .../
    └── BO1/
        └── mods/
            └── mp_t5cine
```

Once this is done open your game, then click on the "Mods" tab. "mp_t5cine" should appear in the list; click on it once and then click on "Launch" to restart your game with the mod on.

A list of commands can be found [here](https://github.com/4GlVE/t5cine/blob/main/commands.txt)

## To-Do List
I know this mod is very bare bones and there is not much to it, but in time I will try to implement every part of Sass' mod into Black Ops.
You can only spawn one bot at a time, and I have not yet implemented a way to kill the bot via command.
* Add the ability to differentiate between bot names for ease of use with commands.
* Add the ability to spawn bots and choosing "class" and "team".
* Add "kill" command.
* Add "vision" command.
* Add "bot model" command.
* Add "hold gun" command.
* Add "score" command. // Similar to "mvm_score"
* Add "killstreak command. // Similar to "mvm_killstreak"
